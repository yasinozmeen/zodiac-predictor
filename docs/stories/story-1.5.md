## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- **From Story 1.1:** Yarn workspaces monorepo structure established with
  frontend (@zodiac/web), backend (@zodiac/api), and shared packages.
  Development infrastructure is in place.

- **From Story 1.2A & 1.2B:** Supabase database integration complete with all
  core tables operational. Database connection and CRUD operations tested and
  working.

- **From Story 1.3:** Frontend development server configured with Vite, React
  Router setup complete. Hot reload functionality working for frontend.

- **From Story 1.4:** Backend Express server running on port 3001 with
  comprehensive middleware stack. Development server using tsx watch for hot
  reload.

### Current Development Environment Status

[Source: Root package.json analysis]

**Already Configured Scripts:**

- `dev`: Concurrent execution of both frontend and backend dev servers
- `build`: Production build across all workspaces using
  `yarn workspaces foreach -A run build`
- `test`: Test execution across all workspaces using
  `yarn workspaces foreach -A run test`
- `lint`: ESLint execution across all workspaces
- `format`: Prettier formatting for all supported file types
- `type-check`: TypeScript checking across workspaces
- `clean`: Cleanup script for all workspaces and cache

### Package Management and Scripts

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#development-tools]

**Package Management:**

- Yarn Workspaces v4.0.0+ for monorepo management
- Workspace dependencies properly configured
- Shared packages structure with @zodiac/shared

**Development Tools:**

- Concurrent for running multiple npm scripts
- Nodemon replacement with tsx watch for backend
- Hot reload configured for frontend via Vite

### Frontend Development Configuration

[Source: apps/web/package.json]

**Frontend Scripts Already Available:**

- `dev`: Vite development server with hot reload
- `build`: TypeScript compilation + Vite production build
- `test`: Vitest test runner with watch mode and coverage
- `lint`: ESLint with TypeScript support
- `type-check`: TypeScript compilation check

**Hot Reload Configuration:**

- Vite development server provides instant hot module replacement
- React Fast Refresh enabled for component updates
- TypeScript changes trigger automatic recompilation

### Backend Development Configuration

[Source: apps/api/package.json]

**Backend Scripts Already Available:**

- `dev`: tsx watch with clear screen disabled for optimal development
- `build`: TypeScript compilation to dist/ directory
- `start`: Production server startup from compiled JavaScript
- `test`: Jest test runner with watch mode
- `lint`: ESLint for TypeScript files

**Hot Reload Configuration:**

- tsx watch provides automatic server restart on file changes
- TypeScript files are compiled and executed in real-time
- Clear screen disabled for better development experience

### Environment Variables Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#security-measures]

**Backend Environment Variables:**

- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3001)
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment (development/production)
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Database connection URL
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Database authentication key
- `FRONTEND_URL` - CORS origin configuration

**Frontend Environment Variables:**
