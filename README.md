## 🏗️ Architecture

This project uses a monorepo structure with Yarn workspaces:

```
zodiac-predictor/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/          # React frontend (Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind)
│   └── api/          # Express backend (TypeScript + MVC)
├── packages/
│   └── shared/       # Common types & utilities
├── docs/             # Project documentation
└── package.json      # Root workspace configuration
```
